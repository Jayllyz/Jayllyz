This is a game made in python with a friend, a strategy game that we imagined and created from scratch.
You are a castaway on an island in the middle of the sea but a storm is coming... good luck 😇

**Well Eat :** it's an application that will be available on smartphone, allowing you to find, share and reference restaurants, pubs and other culinary places with the aim of allowing everyone to enjoy these places, whether they are well known or not.
This is a school project that is still in progress.

**Feel free to check out my other repositories, most of them are school projects but some are interesting. 😉**
