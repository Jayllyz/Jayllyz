##### Here you can find my projects

**Survive The Tempest :**
This is a game made in python with a friend, a strategy game that we imagined and created from scratch.
You are a castaway on an island in the middle of the sea but a storm is coming... good luck 😇

**Topcook :** 
 This is a dynamic website project, the goal is to make a community website about cooking recipes
using PHP & JS. It's also my first year validation project.
